# 📁 Dataset
Source: Retail sales dataset (daily, weekly, or monthly).
File: Provided in CSV/Excel format (uploaded to Google Colab).
Description: Contains historical sales transactions across time, used to analyze patterns, seasonality, and forecast future sales.
# ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. Data Preparation
Mounted Google Drive in Colab and loaded dataset.
Explored dataset: checked shape, data types, missing values.
Cleaned data (handled null values, removed anomalies).
Converted Date column to datetime format and set as index.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized sales trends over time.
Checked seasonality effects (daily, weekly, monthly).
Plotted moving averages and rolling windows.
Detected outliers and unusual sales spikes.
3. Data Preprocessing
Aggregated sales data at chosen level (daily/weekly/monthly).
Normalized/standardized values if needed.
Split dataset into train/test sets for forecasting.
4. Model Building
Implemented forecasting models:
Prophet (Facebook Prophet) → trend + seasonality.
Scikit-learn Regression models → baseline comparison.
Trained models directly in Google Colab.
5. Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Compared actual vs. predicted sales in Colab plots.
6. Visualization & Dashboard
Created visualizations in Matplotlib & Seaborn inside Colab.
Built interactive forecasting plots using Prophet components.
Exported results for dashboard-style reporting.
7. Deployment (Optional)
Shared Colab notebook with outputs & plots.
Option to connect with Google Data Studio / Power BI for dashboard presentation.
